# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool built for scalability in dynamic infrastructures. It collects time-series data from diverse targets, enabling operators to monitor and troubleshoot system performance. Widely used in containerized environments, Prometheus offers a flexible query language and robust alerting system for effective system management.

For custom prometheus configuration add own prometheus yaml and link it in zerops.yaml as its config file.
